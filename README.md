## Voice Cloning Project

## Project Overview

This project presents a real-time voice cloning system implemented using deep learning techniques and the Django web framework. The system allows users to upload audio samples and enter text prompts for generating synthetic speech in the uploaded voice. Leveraging state-of-the-art models such as SpeechT5, the system performs text-to-speech synthesis while preserving the speaker's unique characteristics. Additionally, it incorporates speaker recognition functionality to ensure accurate cloning by extracting speaker embeddings using an EncoderClassifier model. The synthesized speech is rendered in real-time and can be listened to directly on the web interface. The project aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly platform for voice cloning applications, opening avenues for personalized virtual assistants, dubbing in media, and other innovative use cases.

Ethical considerations regarding privacy and consent are addressed, emphasizing responsible deployment of voice cloning technology. Evaluation of the system's performance demonstrates its effectiveness in generating high-quality synthesized speech with minimal latency.

## Conclusion

The GENERATIVE CLONING ONEâ€™S VOICE project has been successfully developed to generate fake or mimic voices instead of original voices. This project clears the disadvantages of previous projects and addresses those errors, executing successfully. It contains a very user-friendly ecosystem and provides a good user experience through a web-based interface.
